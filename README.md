    ## Setup
    * Windows 10
    * IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3.2 (Community Edition)
    * kotlin.jvm 1.7.20
    * Java SDK 17.0.6 (temurin)

    ## Basic Portion
    I did not implement the undo button for each displayed course entry and the conditional WD'ed course count in the status bar, so basic functionalities 10, 11, and 18 are not met completely. However, other functionalities should work out fine.
 
    ## Enhancement 
    I added a new sorting method: 
    * Users can choose to sort displayed courses by course name alphabetically.
    I added a data field in the status bar: 
    * Users can see the highest score obtained in displayed courses.
    * WD'ed courses do not count, so if all displayed courses have grade WD, this field will display 0.
